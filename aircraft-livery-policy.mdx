<Warning>
  You **must** fly the same aircraft you book, including the same variant. If the ICAO code of the aircraft you've flown does not match the ICAO code of the aircraft you have booked.

  \
  This means that if you book a Boeing 777-300ER, you must fly a Boeing 777-300ER. \
  \
  **Failure to follow this will result in your PIREP being Invalidated.** 
</Warning>

<Note>
  The registration on the aircraft you book and what you fly does not matter. Booking A6-ECC and flying A6-ENV does not affect your PIREP. However, we highly recommend you select the correct aircraft registration when dispatching your flight as we have custom aircraft configurations according to the aircraft registration.
</Note>

<Note>
  Not all aircrafts may be available on every route. This depends on the length of a route and the range of an aircraft.
</Note>

### Liveries

You can fly any Emirates and Emirates SkyCargo livery as long as they are real, created by Emirates, and have been flown at some point. This means that you can fly outdated/old liveries.

<Warning>
  Fictional liveries are **not** allowed. Flying a fictional livery will **result in your PIREP beign Invalidated.**
</Warning>
