### Overview

Emirates Virtual uses a rank system to simulate real-world career progression. As you file more PIREPs for Emirates Virtual and gain more flight hours and experience, you'll reach new ranks.

### Rank Structure

| **Pilot Rank**       | **Hours Required** | **Points Required** |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Cadet                | No Requirements    | No Requirements     |
| Second Officer       | 50                 | 1,250               |
| First Officer        | 150                | 2,500               |
| Senior First Officer | 300                | 5,000               |
| Captain              | 600                | 7,525               |
| Training Captain     | 1,000              | 11,750              |
| Base Captain         | 2,000              | 25,000              |

These hours and points have been chosen based off the all-time averages of hours flown and points awarded for every single pilot in the Virtual Airline.

As you rank up, you receive and unlock new Insignias which you can view on the Phoenix Dashboard.

### Tracking your Progress

You can track your progression through:

1. **Phoenix Dashboard**: The dashboard shows your current rank, how many hours flown and how many points you've awarded
2. **Statistics** (My Profile -\> Statistics): This gives you a breakdown of all your flights and gives you averages on various metrics
3. **Ranks **(Documents -\> Ranks): This shows how many PIREPs you have filed, points accumulated and hours flown, along with your current rank and what you need to unlock the next rank.
