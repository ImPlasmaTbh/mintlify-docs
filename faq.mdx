  <Accordion title="Are there any activity requirements?" icon="calendar">
    No\! We have no activity requirements whatsoever. As a predominantly long-haul virtual airline, we understand that pilots may not be able to dedicate that much time to flying long routes - therefore we don't impose any sort of requirements on you. You can fly whenever you want, for however long you want, to any of our destinations\!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to download any software?" icon="download">
    You will need to install our ACARS tracking software called Pegasus. You can find more information about Pegasus [here](/pegasus-setup).

    <Note>
      If you are flying Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and/or 2024, you will need to install FSUIPC as well.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to fly at the same time as the real life flight?" icon="clock">
    No, you can fly at whatever time you want. Your flight also does not need to depart and arrive at the same time as the real-life flight.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about FlyDubai operations?" icon="plane-arrival">
    FlyDubai and Emirates are separate organizations owned by separate groups with the only thing in common being their codeshare flights. When it comes to following Standard Operation Procedures, they are different between the FlyDubai and Emirates and therefore will not be included in any Emirates Virtual routes.
