## Get started in five quick steps\!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account on vAMSYS" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="p">
    Register for an account by [clicking here](https://vamsys.io/register/emirates). You will need to enter your full name, an email address and create a unique and secure password. Afterwards, you wil automatically be redirected to our Pilot Dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your hub">
    After registering an account and joining Emirates Virtual, you will be prompted to choose a hub.

    **If you plan on mainly flying Emirates Passenger operations:**\
    Choose OMDB / DXB as your hub. All scheduled passenger flights depart/arrive into Dubai International Airport.

    **If you plan on mainly flying Emirates SkyCargo operations:**\
    Choose OMDW / DWC as  your hub. All Emirates SkyCargo flights depart/arrive into Al Maktoum International Airport.

    <Note>
      Choosing your hub is not a permanent decision - you can change it any time in the future\!
    </Note>
    <Tip>
      You can also fly SkyCargo operations from OMDB / DXB, but you might only be able to see data for passenger flights. You can also get 25% of the points you earn on a flight that departs/arrive into OMDW / DWC as bonus points\!

  <Step title="Link your Navigraph account">
    When dispatching flights, we use Navigraph's SimBrief to generate flight plans. This includes passenger information, weight information and more.

    On the Pilot Dashboard, access the "**My vAMSYS Account**" settings via the User dropdown top right of the page. You may be prompted to enter your password. Then use the sidebar to navigate to "**Social, Online & 3rd Party**" and connect your Navigraph account.
