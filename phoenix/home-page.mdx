The Dashboard is where you can quickly view and access a lot of information. The dashboard is split into different sections where you can see any alerts, NOTAMS, your statistics, etc. 

### Alerts

At the top center of the dashboard, you will be able to view any and all alerts. These usually contain some new information relating to Emirates Virtual but not related to actual airline operations, such as the launch of our page on MyNextAirline (_you should vote for us @ _[_https://mynextairline.com/airlines/emirates_](https://mynextairline.com/airlines/emirates)_\!_)

Sometimes, you may not see any alert on your dashboard - this means we have nothing of special importance that we want to draw your attention to. 

### Live Flight Globe

To the right of the dashboard, you can view an interactive globe with that shows the current position of all live flights. If you click on a plane icon, you can view the pilot, departure and arrival airport, and flown route.

### Events

If there are any ongoing or upcoming events, you can view an event banner above the Live Flight Globe. You can click it to be taken to the event page where you can see more information regarding the event.

### Your Statistics

You can also view your statistics through a variety of different time periods:

- Today
- Last 24 Hours
- Yesterday
- Last 30 Days
- This Year
- Last Year
- All Time

Here, you can view how many PIREPs you've filed (Accepted, Rejected, Invalidated and Claims), points accumulated, time and distance flown, passengers and freight moved, fuel burned and landing rate, and your Pilot ID.

Below your statistics, you'll find buttons to viewview your booking, any ongoing events, and all your filed PIREPs. 

You will also see upto three of your last filed PIREPs. If you have an active booking, you will see that and two of your last filed PIREPs.

### NOTAMs

Below your statistics, you can view published and active Notice To AirMen (NOTAM). You can quickly view how important they are based off the priority, whether you've read them or not, when the NOTAM expires, the title and when it was published.

### Live Flights

At the bottom of the dashboard, you can view up to 10 live flights. If there are fewer than 10 live flights available, past flights will be shown to fill the list - displaying a total of up to 10 flights.

You can view the Pilot flying, their rank, callsign, departure and arrival airport, aircraft, estimated time of arrival, distance, phase of flight and whether they're connected to VATSIM or IVAO.
