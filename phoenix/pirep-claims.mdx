title: "Filing a PIREP Claim"
---

If you are unable to file your PIREP via our Pegasus ACARS software for whatever reason (software issue, network issue, simulator crash), you can file a "**claim**" to receive points and hours for whatever you have flown.

<Note>
  You need to have proof of flight to file a PIREP Claim, such as a screenshot that clearly shows destination and arrival airport, time flown, landing rate, etc.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Booked Flights">
    1. Open the Phoenix Dashboard and click on the "**Flight Center**" dropdown on the sidebar.
    2. Click on "**View Booking**"

    <Note>
      The booking departure and arrival airport must correspond to the flight you're filing a claim for
    </Note>
    <Note>
      If you donâ€™t see an option to view your flight booking, simply book a new flight from your departure airport to the arrival airport you want to file a claim for.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Claim">
    On the right side of the View Booking page, under "**Booking Actions**", press the "**Manual PIREP / File a Claim**" button. 

    The Departure and Arrival airport will automatically be filled in for you based off your booking. Make sure this matches the flight you're filing a claim for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your Flight Details">
    1. Fill in your departure time, including the date and time in Zulu. 
    2. If you landed, fill in your arrival time, including the date and time in Zulu.
    3. In the message option, enter the reason as to why you're filing a claim (Pegasus issue, sim crash).
    4. Provide proof of flight. This **must** contain the **departure airport**, **arrival airport**, and **flight time. **If possible, provide proof of the departure and arrival times, and the landing rate. These can either be images or links (such as links to your Volanta flight)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit your Claim">
    Press the submit bottom at the bottom of the pop up. This will file a PIREP claim for staff to review.

    <Note>
      PIREP Claims take longer than PIREPs sent for manual review to be reviewed. This is because more effort is required to verify and calculate the flight time and points to be awarded.
