### What is Jumpseating?

Jumpseating is a system that allows pilots to reposition themselves to any airport from your current destination without having to fly there first, essentially simulating a pilot deadheading on a flight to reach the starting point for their next flight.

<Note>
  You can use the Jumpseat system as much as you need to get yourself to your next starting point.

### Jumpseat Resctrictions

There are some limitations to the jumpseat system:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Active Bookings" icon="plane">
    You cannot jumpseat to another airport if you have an active booking. You must either:

    - Complete your booked flight and file a PIREP, or
    - Cancel your booking through the Phoenix Dashboard
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Airport Destinations" icon="building">
    You can only jumpseat to airports that are reachable from your current location - meaning airports you can normally fly to. For example, if you're currently at Milan Malpensa Airport (LIMC / MXP), you can only jumpseat to destinations like John F. Kennedy International (KJFK / JFK) or Dubai International (OMDB / DXB).

    If you'd like to jumpseat to a destination not directly reachable - such as Hong Kong International (VHHH / HKG) - you'll first need to jumpseat to a hub that connects to it, like Dubai International, and then jumpseat from there.
