To access the Book Flight Map, click on the **"Flight Center"** dropdown in the sidebar, then select **"Book Flight Map"**. This will open a globe view displaying all available destinations from your current location.

For example, if you're currently at Milan Malpensa Airport (LIMC / MXP), the map will only show destinations you can reach by departing from LIMC - such as John F. Kennedy International (KJFK / JFK) or Dubai International (OMDB / DXB).

<Note>
  If a destination is marked with a **home icon**, it means you can book a flight to that location. If the destination only has a **small blue dot** with no icon, it indicates that you can only travel there via **jumpseat**.
</Note>

<Note>
  You can jumpseat to any and all of our destinations at any time without flying there. [Click here](/phoenix/jumpseats) to find out more about jumpseating to other airports\!

### Booking a Flight

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the airport you want to depart from">
    Once you've found the airport you want to fly to, click on it once. This will open a pop up top-left of the map. Here, you can view the departure airport, arrival airport, what aircrafts can fly there, and the estimated time and distance.

    Afterwards, click on the "**Book Flight"** button within the pop up. This will redirect you to a different page where you can dispatch your flight.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choosing your Flight">
    Each route has multiple different flights with different callsigns, flight numbers and fleets. Emirates for example has 6 different daily flights from Dubai International (OMDB / DXB) to London Heathrow International (EGLL / LHR).

    Choose the flight that you wish to fly by clicking the **arrow icon** to the right of the flight labelled "Dispatch".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choosing your Plane">
    You will now be prompted to select the aircraft for your flight. Use the **"Narrow Down by Fleet"** dropdown to filter available aircraft by type or fleet (e.g., all available A380s).

    Then, use the **"Select Aircraft"** dropdown to choose the specific aircraft you want to fly. By default, this list displays all available aircraft on your selected route - unless you've applied a fleet filter.

    <Warning>
      Make sure the aircraft type you're flying is the same as the aircraft type you're booking. Read our [Aircrafts and Livery Policy](/aircraft-livery-policy) for more information.
    </Warning>
    Finally, press "**Set Aircraft**" once you've selected it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dispatching your Flight">
    This is the final stage in booking a flight before you can fly. Here, you can see an overview of your entire flight details and customize them to your liking before dispatching.

    You can customize:

    - Aircraft
    - Callsign
    - Flight Number
    - SimBrief Airframe Profile
    - Flight Level
    - Routing (we provide real-life routes wherever applicable, updated monthly to keep it updated with the latest AIRAC. Leave this blank if you want SimBrief to generate one for you)
    - Network (VATSIM or IVAO - you get extra points for flying on a network\!)
    - Shared Cockpit (choose another Emirates Virtual member to fly shared cockpit with)
    - Payload information
    - SimBrief settings

    <Note>
      The Cost Index option is set by us and cannot be changed.
    </Note>
    When you're done configuring all these settings and everything looks good to you, press the "**Create Booking**" button to finally generate an Operating Flight Plan (OFP) and finish dispatching your flight. You will automatically be redirected to your booking page when it's finished generating

    <Note>
      Make sure you have linked your Navigraph account so we can dispatch this flight via SimBrief. You can find out more information on how to do this in our [Quick Start Guide](/quickstart).
    </Note>
